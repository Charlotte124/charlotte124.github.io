          <h1>All About 1989</h1>
          
          <p>Taylor Swifts #3 album in my opinion has to be 1989. 1989 was released October 27th 2014 and it was one of Taylor's first albums where almost all the songs were hits. I love 1989 because so many of the songs on it are pure nonstalga for me and many of her fans.</p>
