          <h1>All About Folklore</h1>
          
          <p>Taylor Swifts #1 album in my opinion has to be Folklore. Folklore was released July 24 2020 and it was a huge change from Taylor's previous albums. Taylor's old style used to be country, and then it changed to pop, and now it is Alternative/Indie</p>
