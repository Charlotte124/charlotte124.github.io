          <h1>All About Lover</h1>
          
          <p>Taylor Swifts #2 album in my opinion has to be Lover. Lover was released August 23rd 2019 and it is still to this day the album that fits best in the Pop music genre. Lover is the happiest album and it is such a fun album to listen to. This album immedietly lifts my mood when I listen to it.</p>
